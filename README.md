## Design

The core of the logo is a big `Z` (my favorite letter), which consists of two `7`s (my favorite number).

The list of my personal colors:

- ![#008000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008000/000000?text=+) `#008000` *green* - representing hope and being organized.
- ![#8a2be2](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8a2be2/000000?text=+) `#8a2be2` *blueviolet* - representing speed, exploring, and hacking to me.

Other colors:

- ![#f8f8ff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f8f8ff/000000?text=+) `#f8f8ff` *ghostwhite* - alternative to white as a background color.
