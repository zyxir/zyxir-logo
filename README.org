** Design

The core of the logo is a big "Z" (my favorite letter), which consists of two
"7"s (my favorite number).

The list of my personal colors:

- [[file:colortags/008000.png]] ~#008000~ /green/ - representing hope and being
  organized.
- [[file:colortags/8a2be2.png]] ~#8a2be2~ /blueviolet/ - representing speed,
  exploring, and hacking.

Other colors:

- [[file:colortags/f8f8ff.png]] ~#f8f8ff~ /ghostwhite/ - alternative to white as a
  background color.
